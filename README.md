Description
-----------
This is a quick port of the sample application BodyBasics-WPF to the SharpDx Toolkit (XNA-like DirectX Wrapper).
It's a decent starting point if you want to branch off into 3D viz or just want more control over 2D viz inside cozy WPF/C# land.

Requirements
------------

* Kinect 4 Windows v2 dev kit
* Latest v2 drivers/firmware
* SharpDx v2.5
* VS2012, Win8
